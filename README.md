# pivot_control_messages_ros
This is a component in the research project [_EndoMersion_](https://github.com/peetcreative/endomersion).
Firstly this ROS-package integrates [pivot_control_messages](https://github.com/peetcreative/pivot_control_messages) into ROS.
Secondly it provides more scripts for running and controlling robot pivoting controllers.

For DOF-Pose in this stage of the pivoting controller project
we refer to the euler angle of the tool at the pivot point (entry hole)
relative to the initial pose the tool started from.
